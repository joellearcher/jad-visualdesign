          This is an image of my great-grandmother. This is a smartphone photo
          of a photo from a film camera. Using Photoshop, I have increased the
          contrast and exposure to create a contrasty image. There is some harsh
          lighting on the image so I have altered the black levels to reduce the
          glare around the middle. I have optimised for the web by exporting and
          choosing the Save for Web option. I then use the PNG-8 128 Dithered
          option and opting for 128 colours from the Look Up Table. The final
          image size is 1500 x 2500 and 900kb, which is ideal for the web and
          shouldn't take too long to load for the user.
