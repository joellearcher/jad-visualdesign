        This is an image of my great-grandmother. This is a smartphone photo of
        a photo from a film camera. Using Photoshop, I have increased the
        contrast and exposure to create a contrasty image. There is some harsh
        lighting on the image so I have altered the black levels to reduce the
        glare around the middle. I have optimised for the web by exporting and
        choosing the Save for Web option. I then use the PNG-8 128 Dithered
        option and opting for 128 colours from the Look Up Table. The final
        image size is 1500 x 2500 and 900kb, which is ideal for the web and
        shouldn't take too long to load for the user.
